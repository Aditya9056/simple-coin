# This is a BlockChain Demo

## This is a Minimum BlockChain ðŸ‘‰ 'Portala Coin'

## Usage

Requires `Node.js` and `npm`.

* Clone the repo
* Run `npm install`
* run `node blockChain.js`

## How it Works

This is using `SHA256` Algorithm to create hashes and everything is just following the basics of a BlockChain.

You can mine your coin from the BlockChain by creating a new `Block` and passing it into the `BlockChain` class.

This will register your block into BlockChain that can be accessed later.
